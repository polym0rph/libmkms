h1. Overview

The MacKeyboardMouseSimulator simulates key press/release, mouse move and mouse click events with the help of mac OS-X "Quartz Event Service":http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Carbon/Reference/QuartzEventServicesRef/Reference/reference.html.

The simulator uses the C API for event taps to alter the stream of low-level 
user input events.

Some parts are taken from "libsikuli":http://github.com/doubleshow/libsikuli.git

h1. Example

<pre>
mkms::MacKeyboardMouseSimulator simulator;

std::cout << "Simulating mouse move" << std::endl;
simulator.mouseMove(100, 100);

std::cout << "Simulating single mouse click" << std::endl;
simulator.mouseSingleClick(1);

std::cout << "Simulating key press 'a' " << std::endl;
simulator.pressOnce(VK_A);
</pre>
